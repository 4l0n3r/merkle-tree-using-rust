# Merkle Tree in Rust 🌳

This is a simple Rust implementation of a **Merkle Tree** that supports:

- Generating a Merkle Tree from a list of `i32` values
- Creating a Merkle Proof for a given leaf node
- Pretty printing the tree and the proof
- Custom display logic for `Node` structs

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.rs` — Contains the core logic and data structures
- `data.txt` (optional) — File for reading integer values (space-separated)
